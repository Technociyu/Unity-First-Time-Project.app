# Unity-First-Time-Project.app
Some copied tutorial practice. It's from the tutorial of Unity Ball Game. Don't take this project seriously. 

So people, I basically copied a tutorial project to github? 
Why? Just to have some past old projects as archives while working on other projects. Maybe for some reference use I guess.
Yea that's all.
